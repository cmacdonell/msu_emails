I did not receive much help and was told that the university server was only for people with large data needs.  In the hectic rush to the start of my first academic position, I never developed/implemented a solid backup system. I would just save certain files to an external hard drive - but only when I remembered and had time - because it took a long time to transfer the files.  Unfortunately, I had not backed up my files for ~2 months prior to the theft of my laptop.  I lost several important documents and am still trying to sort out what I had backed up and what I lost.  The lack of a solid backup system for my Dell was the main impetus for getting a Mac, which appears, to me, to have a smoother, more straight forward backup system (i.e, Time Machine).  This is a bit unfortunate as Mac's are not compatible with all University systems (i.e., it makes using Clickers in the classroom more complicated).

My primary research interests are to understand the intricate gene regulatory mechanisms that function in development and maintenance of complex organisms, like ourselves.  Much of our work involves analyses of mouse lines we produce that bear targeted mutations (e.g., ""knockouts""); however, our approaches to understanding the roles of the mutated genes are broad, including phylogenetics, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, histology, biophysics, genomics, proteomics, and other techniques.  The biological processes we are studying include early embryonic patterning and development, placental physiology, germ cell maturation, immune cell functions, the maternal/fetal immune interaction, liver development and regeneration,",1,1,1,1,,,,"Some of my personnel have access to a CoA server.

There are multiple projects with different practices. Broadly speaking, I'm involved in satellite missions that share data on open repositories, and I also have a sounding rocket program with data stored locally. The latter data is available to my students, but is occasionally shared with people at other institutions on request. The latter is tricky, because it is harder for an outsider to understand our data and use it appropriately. I do not have sufficient resources to provide well-documented data, calibration routines, and support to the scientific community.",,,1,"Depends on which dataset. This is a complicated question for the satellite data, but that is handled by our collaboration with other institutions and is very well documented. For the locally generated sounding rocket data, we have an automatically generated xml catalog file. Higher level data products are documented in a variety of ways, including an online html lab notebook and detailed comments in the data reduction scripts.",Wide variety. Starts with our experiment flight software generating xml catalog files. html is hand coded. Also comments in IDL data reduction routines.,,1,1,1,,Charles Kankelborg,kankel@solar.physics.montana.edu,,45.62800598,-110.9012985,-1
